A small Bash script to quickly find the fastest NordVPN servers, filtering the results by location and current capacity.

The script uses an undocumented NordVPN API endpoint for the quickest result.

Usage:

nordvpn-server-find -l <location> -c <capacity>

<location> must be a 2-letter country code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard (ex: us, uk, de...)
<capacity> must be an integer between 1-100 (defaults to 70)

Dependencies:

- Bash 4
- jq 1.5

Todo:

- dependencies check
- usage information with -h

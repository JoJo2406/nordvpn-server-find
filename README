Small script to find the fastest NordVPN servers, filtering by
location and current capacity (i.e. server load).

Super useful if you use a third-party VPN client (like Viscosity)
and want to quickly find which server to connect to.

The script calls an undocumented NordVPN API endpoint for quickest
results.

USAGE

nordvpn-server-find -l <location> -c <capacity>

<location>   2-letter ISO 3166-1 country code (ex: us, uk, de)
<capacity>   integer between 1-100 (defaults to 70)

DEPENDENCIES

- Bash 4
- jq 1.5
